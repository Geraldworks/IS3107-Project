       "  'jobDescription': \"Summary\\n\\nPosted: 21 Feb 2024\\n\\nRole Number:200539726\\n\\nAt Apple, extraordinary ideas have a way of becoming excellent products, services, and customer experiences very quickly. Bring passion and dedication to your job and there's no telling what you could accomplish. Apple's Global Business Intelligence (GBI) team is seeking an experienced Software Engineer to build high quality, scalable and resilient distributed systems that power Apple's analytics platforms and data pipelines. Apple's Enterprise Data Warehouse landscape caters to a wide variety of real-time, near real-time and batch analytical solutions. These solutions are an integral part of business functions like Sales, Operations, Finance, AppleCare, Marketing and Internet Services, enabling business drivers to make critical decisions. We utilize proprietary and open source technologies, Kafka, Spark, Iceberg, Airflow, Presto, etc. If you are looking to solve infrastructure problems at scale, both on-prem or in cloud, focusing on ease of use, ease of maintenance and most importantly implement solutions that are scalable, you will have fun in GBI! The ideal candidate for this position will be able to think outside of the box and should have passion for building engineering solutions to enable business in making time sensitive and critical decisions. If you feel this is you, we'd love to hear from you!\\n\\nKey Qualifications\\nKnowledge of BI concepts and implementation experience on Cloud with databases like SnowFlake, Big Query, Cloudera\\nUnderstanding of fundamentals of object-oriented design, data structures, algorithm design, and problem solving\\nProgramming experience in building high quality software.

Our core systems are diverse and come with an unusual intersection of high data volumes with systems distributed across cloud and on-premise infrastructure. On our team you will build solutions that integrate open source software with Appleʼs internal ecosystem. You will drive development of new components and features from concept to release: design, build, test, and ship at a regular cadence. You will work closely with internal customers to understand their requirements and workflows, and propose new features and ecosystem changes to streamline their experience of using the solutions on our platform. This is a true software engineering role, where a large part of an engineer's time is spent in writing code and designing/developing applications on cloud, with the remainder being spent on tuning and debugging codebase, supporting production applications and supporting our application end-users.
